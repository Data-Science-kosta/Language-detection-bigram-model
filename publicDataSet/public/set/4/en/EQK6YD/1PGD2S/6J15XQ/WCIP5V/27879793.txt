John Charles Willke (April 5, 1925 â€“ February 20, 2015) was an American author, physician, and anti-abortion activist. Along with his wife Barbara, he authored a number of books on abortion and human sexuality. Willke was an obstetrician in Cincinnati, Ohio, but ceased practicing medicine in 1988 in order to devote himself full-time to the anti-abortion movement. He was president of National Right to Life from 1984 through 1991.  He co-founded the Life Issues Institute in 1991. Willke was a proponent of the concept that women's bodies can resist pregnancy resulting from sexual assault, a position which the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists stated in 2012 is false.
