The Jeopardy! Teen Tournament is one of the traditional tournaments held each season on the TV quiz show Jeopardy! Contestants in this tournament are primarily high school students, and between the ages of thirteen and seventeen. The daily syndicated version of the show has conducted Teen Tournament each season since 1987 (Season 3), with two being held in Season 23 (2006–07). In the last two weeks of July 2007, a second Teen Tournament took place which was known as the Summer Games Tournament, making this the first (and only, to date) time in the daily syndicated Jeopardy!'s 23-year history that there were two Teen Tournaments held in the same season.  Because of the Jeopardy! Battle of the Decades, the Season 30 Teen Tournament aired after regular non tournament play has ended (July 21 to August 1, 2014). There was no teen Tournament in season 31 (2014–15), season 32 (2015–16) and season 34 (2017-18).
The format used by the Teen Tournament format is identical to that of the Tournament of Champions and the College Championship: 5 quarterfinal games produce 5 semifinalists (winners) and 4 wildcard semifinalists (high scorers among nonwinners); 3 semifinals produce 3 finalists who compete in a 2-game final.
