Hubertus Leteng (; born 1 January 1959) is an Indonesian Roman Catholic bishop. He served as the Bishop of Ruteng from 2010 to October 2017, when he resigned amidst scandals involving allegations of theft and of having a mistress. Before being named a bishop, he worked as a lecturer at a local seminary.
Leteng was born in Ruteng, on the western part of Flores island in East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. He attended both high school and college seminary at St. Pius XII Seminary, graduating in 1979. From 1982 to 1984, he continued his studies at Ledalero Catholic College of Philosophy in Maumere. He returned to St. Pius for three more years and was ordained to the priesthood in 1988. Between 1992 and 1996 he completed his doctoral studies at the Pontifical Theological Faculty Teresianum in Rome, Italy. Upon returning home to Indonesia, Leteng became a lecturer at his alma mater, Ledalero Catholic College, where he remained until his appointment as bishop over a decade later.
In November 2009, Leteng was appointed Bishop of Ruteng by Pope Benedict XVI. He was the first priest of the Diocese of Ruteng to be appointed its bishop. His episcopal consecration was held in April 2010 with a large ceremony held in a public square in Ruteng and attended by thousands, including the governor of East Nusa Tenggara and around 30 bishops. Bishop of Maumere Gerulfus Kherubim Pareira served as the principal consecrator.
By early 2014, Leteng was the subject of allegations spreading on social media. The rumors accused him of misuse of church funds and of having an affair with a woman. The Diocese of Ruteng released a statement denying the rumors. In 2015, two-thirds of the diocese's 167 priests signed a letter of "no confidence" in the bishop. In July 2017, the accusations against him once again arose. In June 2017, 69 of the diocese's priests resigned in protest of his leadership, demanding major changes in the way the diocese was being run. The priests accused Leteng of borrowing $94,000 from the Bishops' Conference of Indonesia and taking $30,000 from the Diocese of Ruteng, without providing accountability records. Leteng claimed he was using the money to pay for the overseas education of a young local man, but refused to provide details. Many of his accusers believed the money was going to his alleged mistress, which Leteng called "slanderous." In early August, the Holy See became involved, appointing another bishop as apostolic visitor of the Ruteng diocese. On 11 October 2017, Leteng's resignation was accepted by Pope Francis. Leteng was told by Vatican officials that he must repay the money he had taken, and as of 17 October, he has paid back $5,550.
